Welcome to the **Psychometrics and Data Science with R** blog!

I am an Associate Professor in the [Measurement, Evaluation, and Data Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/educational-psychology/graduate-programs/measurement-evaluation-and-data-sciences/index.html) program at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). I teach graduate courses and workshops on psychometrics, educational measurement, and statistical modeling using R. For more information, you can visit my personal website: [www.okanbulut.com](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/okanbulut).

As a passionate R user, I always conduct statistical and psychometric analysis on educational and psychological data using R. I often write my own functions but I also benefit from the existing R packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and other platforms. In 2018, my colleague Chris Desjardins and I co-authored the [Handbook of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Educational-Measurement-and-Psychometrics-Using-R/Desjardins-Bulut/p/book/9781498770132). We wanted to present important topics in measurement and psychometrics as well as their applications in R. Our book comes with a complimentary package, **hemp**, that helps our readers reproduce the content presented in the book. The **hemp** package and R script files for each chapter of our book are available on GitHub: <https://github.com/cddesja/hemp>.   

In this blog, I hope to continue sharing psychometric applications using R. In addition, I plan to present new examples focusing on the state-of-the-art methods in data science and educational data mining. Questions, comments, and suggestions from all readers are welcomed! Lastly, if my blog has helped you, you can [buy me coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/okanbulut) :-)
