I teach graduate courses and workshops on\r\n            psychometrics, machine learning, and statistical modeling\r\n            using R. For more information, you can visit my personal\r\n            website: www.okanbulut.com.\r\n            As a passionate R user, I conduct statistical and\r\n            psychometric analysis on educational and psychological data\r\n            using R. I often write my own functions but I also benefit\r\n            from the existing R packages available on CRAN, GitHub, and other platforms.\r\n            In 2018, my colleague Chris Desjardins and I co-authored the\r\n            Handbook\r\n            of Educational Measurement and Psychometrics Using R. We\r\n            wanted to present important topics in measurement and\r\n            psychometrics as well as their applications in R. Our book\r\n            comes with a complimentary package, hemp,\r\n            that helps our readers reproduce the content presented in\r\n            the book. The hemp package and R script\r\n            files for each chapter of our book are available on GitHub:\r\n            https://github.com/cddesja/hemp.\r\n            In this blog, I hope to continue sharing psychometric\r\n            applications using R. In addition, I also plan to present\r\n            new examples focusing on the state-of-the-art methods in\r\n            psychometrics, data science, and educational data mining\r\n            using Python. Questions, comments, and suggestions from all\r\n            readers are welcomed!
