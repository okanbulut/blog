## Introduction

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to learn a new statistical technique to keep my mind occupied instead of watching the news all the time. Among the several techniques I reviewed, those related to natural language processing (NLP) were the most interesting ones. So, I decided to choose one technique from this field and learn more about it. This was sentiment analysis, which is also referred to as "opinion mining" in the literature. This analytical approach enables researchers to extract and interpret emotions expressed towards a particular subject in a written text. With sentiment analysis, one can discern the polarity (positive or negative), nature, and intensity of sentiments expressed across various textual formats such as documents, customer reviews, and social media posts.

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous researchers turned to sentiment analysis to gauge public responses to news and developments surrounding the virus. This included scrutinizing user-generated content on popular social media platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. Inspired by this approach, my colleagues and I aimed to expand upon existing research by analyzing the daily briefings delivered by public health authorities. In Alberta, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province's chief medical officer of health, regularly provided [updates on the region's response to the ongoing pandemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvw_USRfXgY), Through our analysis of these public health announcements, we sought to evaluate Alberta's effectiveness in employing communication strategies during this complex public health crisis [@sentimentbulut; @sentimentpoth].

In this post, my aim is to guide you through the process of conducting sentiment analysis using R. Specifically, I'll delve into "lexicon-based sentiment analysis," which I'll detail in the next section. You'll find examples of lexicon-based sentiment analysis that we've incorporated into our publications mentioned above. In upcoming posts, I'll also explore more sophisticated forms of sentiment analysis leveraging cutting-edge pretrained models available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index).

## Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis

As I began to explore sentiment analysis, I found that the most common method of extracting sentiments was through lexicon-based sentiment analysis. This technique involves the use of a specific lexicon, which is essentially the vocabulary of a language or subject, to determine the direction and strength of sentiments expressed in a given text. Some lexicons, such as the Bing lexicon [@hu2004mining], categorize words as either positive or negative. Other lexicons offer more descriptive labels for the sentiments, such as the NRC Emotion Lexicon [@mohammad2013crowdsourcing], which categorizes words based on both positive and negative sentiments and Plutchikâ€™s [@plutchik1980general] psych evolutionary theory of basic emotions (i.e., anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust).

Lexicon-based sentiment analysis is a process that involves matching words in a given text with the words present in general-purpose lexicons like NRC and Bing. Each word is assigned a specific sentiment, such as positive or negative. The overall sentiment score of the text is then calculated by adding up the individual sentiment scores of each word. For example, if a text contains 50 positive and 30 negative words based on the Bing lexicon, the total sentiment score would be 20, which indicates that the text expresses mostly positive sentiments. Conversely, a negative value would suggest the opposite sentiment.

Performing lexicon-based sentiment analysis using R can be both fun and tricky at the same time. While analyzing public health announcements in terms of sentiments, I found Julia Silge and David Robinson's book, [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), to be very helpful. The book has [a chapter dedicated to sentiment analysis](https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment), where the authors demonstrate how to conduct sentiment analysis using general-purpose lexicons like Bing and NRC. However, Julia and David also highlight a major limitation of lexicon-based sentiment analysis. The analysis considers only single words (i.e., unigrams) and does not consider qualifiers before a word. For instance, negation words like "not" in "not true" are ignored, and sentiment analysis processes them as two separate words, "not" and "true". Furthermore, if a particular word (either positive or negative) is repeatedly used throughout the text, this may skew the results depending on the polarity (positive or negative) of this word. Therefore, the results of lexicon-based sentiment analysis should be interpreted carefully.
