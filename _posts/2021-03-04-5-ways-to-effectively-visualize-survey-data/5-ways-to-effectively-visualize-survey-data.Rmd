title: "5 Ways to Effectively Visualize Survey Data"
description: |
  Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a sophisticated methodology to create measurement instruments that are highly accurate and efficient. In this post, I explain how to evaluate the feasibility of creating a computerized adaptive version of a psychological instrument. 
  ```{r, include=FALSE}
  bytes <- file.size("5-ways-to-effectively-visualize-survey-data.Rmd")
  words <- bytes/10
  minutes <- words/200
  ``` 
  (`r round(minutes)` min read)

## Introduction

In CSSE 2019, I gave a half-day training on how to visualize assessment and survey items effectively (the training slides are available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/okanbulut/dataviz/raw/master/CSSE_Workshop.pdf))^[The other training materials are available at <https://github.com/okanbulut/dataviz>.].
