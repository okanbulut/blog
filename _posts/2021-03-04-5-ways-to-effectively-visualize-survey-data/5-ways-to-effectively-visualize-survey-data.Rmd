title: "5 Ways to Effectively Visualize Survey Data"
description: |
  Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a sophisticated methodology to create measurement instruments that are highly accurate and efficient. In this post, I explain how to evaluate the feasibility of creating a computerized adaptive version of a psychological instrument. 
  ```{r, include=FALSE}
  bytes <- file.size("5-ways-to-effectively-visualize-survey-data.Rmd")
  words <- bytes/10
  minutes <- words/200
  ``` 
  (`r round(minutes)` min read)

## Introduction

In CSSE 2019, I gave a half-day training on how to visualize assessment and survey items effectively (the training slides are available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/okanbulut/dataviz/raw/master/CSSE_Workshop.pdf))^[The other training materials are available at <https://github.com/okanbulut/dataviz>.].


```{r dataviz, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Types of data visualization (Source: https://extremepresentation.com/)", out.extra="class=external", fig.width=6, fig.height=4, layout="l-body-outset"}
# Visual summary of results
knitr::include_graphics("dataviz.png")
```


```{r nakeddata, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Types of data visualization (Source: https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked)", out.extra="class=external", fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Visual summary of results
knitr::include_graphics("data-ink.gif")
```
