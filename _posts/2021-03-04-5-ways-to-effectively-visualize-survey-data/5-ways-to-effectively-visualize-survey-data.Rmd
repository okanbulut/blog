title: "5 Ways to Effectively Visualize Survey Data"
description: |
  When presented visually, survey results become much more interesting than some numbers squeezed into a boring table. Data visualizations help your audience view and understand key insights in the results. There are many data visualization tools to present survey results visually, including bar charts, pie charts, and line charts. In this post, I demonstrate 5 alternative ways to visualize survey results.

## Introduction

As a visual learner, I often use data visualization to present the results of surveys and other types of self-report measures (e.g., psychological scales). In the 2019 annual meeting of [the Canadian Society for the Study of Education (CSSE)](https://csse-scee.ca/), I gave a half-day workshop on how to visualize assessment and survey items effectively (the workshop slides are available on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/okanbulut/dataviz/raw/master/CSSE_Workshop.pdf))^[The other training materials are available at <https://github.com/okanbulut/dataviz>.]. My goal was to demonstrate readily-available tools that can be used for creating effective visualizations with survey and assessment data. Since my CSSE workshop in 2019, I have come across several other tools that can be quite useful for presenting survey results visually. So, I have decided to share them with other researchers in social and behavioral sciences through a blog post.   

There are several ways to visualize data, depending on the type of variables as well as the message to be conveyed to the audience. Figure \@ref(fig:dataviz) presents some guidelines regarding which type of visualization to choose depending on the purpose of visualization, type of variables, and the number of variables. Similar guidelines for data visualization are available on the [Venngage](https://venngage.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-charts-for-your-infographic/) website. Also, I definitely recommend you to check out Darkhorse Analytics' blog post "[Data Looks Better Naked](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked)". They demonstrate how to create effective visualizations by eliminating redundancy in figures and charts.

```

In this post, I will use real data from a questionnaire included in OECD's [Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/). PISA is an international, large-scale assessment administered to 15-year-old students across many countries and economies around the world. In 2015, nearly 540,000 students from 72 countries participated in PISA. After finishing reading, math, and science assessments, students also complete a questionnaire with several items focusing on their learning in school, their attitudes towards different aspects of learning, and non-cognitive/metacognitive constructs. Using students' responses in the questionnaire, I will demonstrate five alternative tools to visualize survey data. 

Let's get started `r emo::ji("metrics")`.


## Example

In this example, we will use a subset of the PISA 2015 dataset that includes students' responses to some survey items as well as demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, and immigration status). The sample only consists of students who participated in PISA 2015 from Alberta, Canada ($n = 2,133$). The data set is available in a .csv format [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okanbulut/blog/master/data_and_codes/PISA_Alberta.csv).

There are 10 Likert-type survey items **potentially** measuring students' attitudes towards teamwork. The first eight items share the question statement: "To what extent do you disagree or agree about yourself?". The last two items are independent. Now let's see all of the items included in the data. 

```{r ch0, echo=FALSE}
quest <- read.csv("questions.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = 999)
colnames(quest) <- c("Question ID", "Question Statement")

kbl(quest) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                full_width = TRUE, position = "left")
```

Students can answer the items by selecting one the following response options or skip them without choosing a response option (999 in the data):

* 1 = Strongly disagree
* 2 = Disagree
* 3 = Agree
* 4 = Strongly agree

We will begin the analysis by reading the data in R and previewing the first few rows. 

```{r ch1, eval=FALSE}
# Read the data in R
data <- read.csv("PISA_Alberta.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = 999)

# Preview the data
head(data)
```

```{r ch2, echo=FALSE}
# Read the data in R
data <- read.csv("PISA_Alberta.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings = 999)
paged_table(data, options = list(cols.print = 12))
```

In the following sections, I will demonstrate how to visualize the items in the PISA data set. The visualizations focus on either individual items or the relationship among the items.


### Correlation Matrix Plot

We will begin the visualization process by creating a correlation matrix plot. This plot takes the correlation matrix of items as an input and transforms it into a colored table similar to a heatmap. Negative and positive correlations are represented by different colors. Also, the darkness (or lightness) of the colors indicate the strength of pairwise correlations. Using this plot, we can:

* understand the direction and strength of the relationships among the items,
* detect problematic items (i.e., items that are weakly correlated with the rest of the items), and
* identify the items that may require reverse-coding due to inconsistent phrasing (e.g., negative phrasing in some items).

To create a correlation matrix plot, we can use either **corrplot** [@corrplot] or **ggcorrplot** [@ggcorrplot]. First, we will select the survey items (those starting with ST082 and ST034 in the data). Next, we will save pairwise correlations among the items (i.e., a 10x10 matrix of correlations). Finally, we will create a correlation matrix plot using the two aforementioned packages. For preparing the data for the data visualizations, we will use the **dplyr** package [@dplyr].


```{r ch3.1, eval=FALSE}
# Activate the dplyr package
library("dplyr")

# Correlation matrix of items
cormat <- data %>%
  select(starts_with(c("ST082", "ST034"))) %>%
  cor(., use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

Now using "cormat", let's create our correlation matrix plot using **corrplot**. In the corrplot function, order = "hclust" applies hierarchical clustering to group the items together based on their correlations with each other. The other option, addrect = 2, refers to the number of rectangles that we want to draw around the item clusters. In our example, I suspect that there will be two clusters: one for the first 8 items (focusing on teamwork) and another for the last 2 items (focusing on being liked by friends). Item clusters in Figure \@ref(fig:ch4) seem to confirm our suspicion. 


```{r ch3.2, eval=FALSE}
# Activate the corrplot package
library("corrplot")

# Correlation matrix plot
corrplot(cormat, # correlation matrix
         order = "hclust", # hierarchical clustering of correlations
         addrect = 2) # number of rectangles to draw around clusters
```


```{r ch4, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Correlation matrix plot of the PISA survey items (using corrplot)", layout="l-body-outset"}
# Correlation matrix of items
cormat <- data %>%
  select(starts_with(c("ST082", "ST034"))) %>%
  cor(., use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Correlation matrix plot
corrplot(cormat, order = "hclust", addrect = 2)
```

Next, we will use **ggcorrplot** to create a correlation matrix plot. The procedure is very similar. By using type = "lower", we will only visualize the lower diagonal part of the correlation matrix. 

```{r ch5, eval=FALSE}
library("ggcorrplot")

# Correlation matrix plot
ggcorrplot(cormat, # correlation matrix
           type = "lower", # print the lower part of the correlation matrix
           hc.order = TRUE, # hierarchical clustering of correlations
           lab = TRUE) # add correlation values as labels
```


```{r ch6, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Correlation matrix plot of the PISA survey items (using ggcorrplot)", layout="l-body-outset"}
library("ggcorrplot")

# Correlation matrix plot
ggcorrplot(cormat, # correlation matrix
           type = "lower", # print the lower part of the correlation matrix
           hc.order = TRUE, # hierarchical clustering of correlations
           lab = TRUE) # add correlation values as labels
```

Both correlation matrix plots confirm our initial suspicion that the last two items (i.e., ST034Q02 and ST034Q05) are not correlated with the rest of the survey items. If we are building a scale focusing on "teamwork", we can exclude these two items since they would not contribute to the scale sufficiently. 


### UpSet Plot

The next visualization tools that we will try is called "UpSet plot". UpSet plots can show the intersections of multiple sets of data. These plots allow users to visualize complex set of relationships among variables from different data sets. This visualization method enables users to combine different plots (e.g., venn diagrams, bar charts, etc.) based on the intersections in the data. You can watch [this nice video](https://youtu.be/-IfF2wGw7Qk) to better understand the design and use of UpSet plots^[See Johannes Kepler University's [Visual Data Science Lab](https://jku-vds-lab.at/tools/upset/#:~:text=UpSet%20plots%20the%20intersections%20of,as%20indicated%20in%20the%20figure.&text=This%20figure%20shows%20a%20Simpsons,in%20a%20corresponding%20Venn%20diagram.) for further information.]. In R, the **UpSetR** package [@upsetr] can be used to generate UpSet plots. The creators of the package also have a [Shiny](https://gehlenborglab.shinyapps.io/upsetr/) app and a web version (<https://vcg.github.io/upset/>) that help users generate UpSet plots without any coding in R. 

In our example, we will use the **naniar** package [@naniar] to create an UpSet plot for visualizing missing data. The **naniar** package offers several tools for visualizing missing data, including UpSet plots^[Check out the package's GitHub page: <https://github.com/njtierney/naniar>]. Using this package, we will create an UpSet package that will show us missing response patterns in our survey data. First, we will select the survey items in the data and then send the items to the gg_miss_upset function to create an UpSet plot. In the function, nsets = 10 refers to the number of item sets that we want to visualize. So, we use 10 to visualize all of the ten items in the data. In addition, we can use nintersects argument (e.g., nintersects = 10) to change the number of intersections to be shown in the plot. 


```{r ch8,eval=FALSE}
library("naniar")

data %>%
  # Select the survey items
  select(starts_with(c("ST082", "ST034"))) %>%
  # Create an UpSet plot
  gg_miss_upset(., nsets = 10)
```


```{r ch9,echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=5, layout="l-body-outset", fig.cap="An UpSet plot showing missing data patterns among the PISA survey items"}
data %>%
  # Select only the relevant survey items
  select(starts_with(c("ST082", "ST034"))) %>%
  # Create an UpSet plot
  gg_miss_upset(., nsets = 10)
```

We can use Figure \@ref(fig:ch9) to understand the number of missing responses per item. For example, if we look at the first row (ST082Q01), we can see that there are 83 missing responses based on the sum of the three frequencies marked for this item (i.e., 79 + 3 + 1). In addition, we can use the plot to identify missing response patterns. For example, the plot shows that 79 students skipped all of the survey items without selecting an answer (see the first vertical bar), while 13 students skipped either ST034Q05 or ST082Q14 (see the second and third vertical bars). Each column represents a different combination of items with missing responses (i.e., those with black marks). The UpSet plot can help researchers identify problematic item groups in terms of missingness. 

### Stacked Bar Chart

The next visualization tool is the stacked bar chart. Stacked bar charts are not necessarily very exciting forms of data visualization but they are widely used in survey research to visually present Likert-type items. The **likert** package [@likert] offers a relatively straightforward way to create stacked bar charts for survey items. Without diving into all the options to customize these charts, I will demonstrate how to create a simple stacked bar chart using the first eight items focusing on teamwork. Since the **likert** package relies on the **plyr** package, we will have to activate both packages before running the codes. 


```{r ch10, eval=FALSE}

library("likert")
library("plyr")

# Select only the first 8 items in the survey
items <- select(data, starts_with(c("ST082")))

# Rename the items so that the question statement becomes the name
names(items) <- c(
  ST082Q01="I prefer working as part of a team to working alone.",
  ST082Q02="I am a good listener.",
  ST082Q03="I enjoy seeing my classmates be successful.",
  ST082Q08="I take into account what others are interested in.",
  ST082Q09="I find that teams make better decisions than individuals.",
  ST082Q12="I enjoy considering different perspectives.",
  ST082Q13="I find that teamwork raises my own efficiency.",
  ST082Q14="I enjoy cooperating with peers.")

# A custom function to recode numerical responses into ordered factors
likert_recode <- function(x) {
  y <- ifelse(is.na(x), NA,
              ifelse(x == 1, "Strongly disagree",
                     ifelse(x == 2, "Disagree",
                            ifelse(x == 3, "Agree", "Strongly agree"))))
  
  y <- factor(y, levels = c("Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Agree", "Strongly agree"))
  
  return(y)
}

# Transform the items into factors and save the data set as a likert object
items_likert <- items %>%
  mutate_all(likert_recode) %>%
  likert()

# Create a stacked bar chart
plot(items_likert, 
     # Group the items alphabetically
     group.order=names(items),
     # Plot the percentages for each response category
     plot.percents = TRUE,
     # Plot the total percentage for negative responses
     plot.percent.low = FALSE,
     # Plot the total percentage for positive responses
     plot.percent.high = FALSE,
     # Whether response categories should be centered
     # This is only helpful when there is a middle response
     # option such as "neutral" or "neither agree nor disagree"
     centered = FALSE,
     # Wrap label text for item labels
     wrap=30)
```


```{r ch11, eval=TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, layout="l-body-outset", fig.cap="A stacked bar chart of the PISA survey items"}
items <- select(data, starts_with(c("ST082")))

names(items) <- c(
  ST082Q01="I prefer working as part of a team to working alone.",
  ST082Q02="I am a good listener.",
  ST082Q03="I enjoy seeing my classmates be successful.",
  ST082Q08="I take into account what others are interested in.",
  ST082Q09="I find that teams make better decisions than individuals.",
  ST082Q12="I enjoy considering different perspectives.",
  ST082Q13="I find that teamwork raises my own efficiency.",
  ST082Q14="I enjoy cooperating with peers.")

likert_recode <- function(x) {
  y <- ifelse(is.na(x), NA,
              ifelse(x == 1, "Strongly disagree",
                     ifelse(x == 2, "Disagree",
                            ifelse(x == 3, "Agree", "Strongly agree"))))
  
  y <- factor(y, levels = c("Strongly disagree", "Disagree", 
                            "Agree", "Strongly agree"))
  
  return(y)
}

items_likert <- items %>%
  mutate_all(likert_recode) %>%
  likert()

plot(items_likert, 
     group.order=names(items),
     plot.percents = TRUE,
     plot.percent.low = FALSE,
     plot.percent.high = FALSE,
     centered = FALSE,
     wrap=30)
```


### Alluvial Plot

Alluvial plots (or diagrams) are similar to flow diagrams that represent changes over time or between different groups. Using an alluvial plot, we can demonstrate the flow of survey responses between different items or between different groups of respondents. In this example, we will use the **ggalluvial** package [@ggalluvial]. You can check out the package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggalluvial/vignettes/ggalluvial.html) for more examples. We will choose one of the survey items and create an alluvial plot using gender, immigration status, and responses given to the item. 


```{r ch12, eval=TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, layout="l-body-outset"}
library("reshape2")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggalluvial")

# Transform the data from wide format to long format
data_long <- mutate(data,
                    # Create categorical gender and immigration variables
                    gender = ifelse(ST004D01T == 1, "Female", "Male"),
                    immigration = factor(
                      ifelse(is.na(IMMIG), NA, 
                                         ifelse(IMMIG == 1, "Native", 
                                                ifelse(IMMIG == 2, "Second-Generation", 
                                                       "First-Generation"))),
                      levels = c("Native", "First-Generation", "Second-Generation")
                    )) %>%
  # Drop old variables
  select(-ST004D01T, -IMMIG) %>%
  # Make the variable names easier
  rename(grade = ST001D01T,
         student = CNTSTUID,
         age = AGE) %>%
  # Melt data to long format
  melt(data = .,
       id.vars = c("student", "grade", "age", "gender", "immigration"),
       variable.name = "question",
       value.name = "response") %>%
  mutate(
    # Recode numerical responses to character strings
    response2 = (ifelse(is.na(response), "Missing",
                        ifelse(response == 1, "Strongly disagree",
                               ifelse(response == 2, "Disagree",
                                      ifelse(response == 3, "Agree", "Strongly agree"))))),
    # Reorder factors
    response3 = factor(response2, levels = c("Missing", "Strongly disagree", "Disagree", 
                                             "Agree", "Strongly agree"))
    
  ) 


# Create a frequency table for one of the items
ST082Q01 <- data_long %>%
  filter(question == "ST082Q01") %>%
  group_by(gender, immigration, response3) %>%
  summarise(Freq = n())
  

ggplot(ST082Q01,
       aes(y = Freq, axis1 = gender, axis2 = immigration, axis3 = response3)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = gender), width = 1/12) +
  geom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = "black", color = "grey") +
  geom_label(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("gender", "immigration", "response3"), expand = c(.1, .1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
  ggtitle("I prefer working as part of a team to working alone.")
```


### Item-Person Map

```{r ch13, eval=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, layout="l-body-outset", fig.cap="An item-person map of the items"}

#detach("package:plyr", unload=TRUE)

# Save the items as a separate dataset
items <- select(data, starts_with(c("ST082")))

# Change responses from 1-2-3-4 to 0-1-2-3 by subtracting 1
items2 <- apply(items, 2, function(x) x-1)

# Apply the Partial Credit Model
mod <- mirt(items2, 1, itemtype = "Rasch", technical = list(removeEmptyRows=TRUE),
            verbose = FALSE)


# Create the item-person map
itempersonmap(mod)
```
