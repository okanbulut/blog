title: "How to Shorten a Measurement Instrument Automatically (Part II)"
description: |
  Reducing the number of items in an existing measurement instrument (e.g., tests, surveys,
  questionnaires) is almost as tedious as creating a new instrument. Going through all of 
  the items one by one and choosing the appropriate ones based on personal judgment could be highly 
  laborious and inefficient. In this two-part series, I will demonstrate how to shorten a
  measurement instrument automatically in R. The first part focuses on the use of automated test
  assembly and recursive feature elimination for the automatic selection of items.
  ```{r, include=FALSE}
  bytes <- file.size("how-to-shorten-a-measurement-instrument-automatically-part-ii.Rmd")
  words <- bytes/10
  minutes <- words/200
  ``` 
  (`r round(minutes)` min read)
