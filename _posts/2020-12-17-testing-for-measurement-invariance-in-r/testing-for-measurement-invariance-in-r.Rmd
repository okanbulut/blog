title: "Testing for Measurement Invariance in R"
description: |
  Explanatory item response modeling (EIRM) is a flexible framework that 
  allows researchers to model both person and item characteristics as predictors together. 
  In this post, I demonstrate how to use the `eirm` package to estimate explanatory IRT 
  models in R. 
  ```{r, include=FALSE}
  bytes <- file.size("explanatory-irt-models-in-r.Rmd")
  words <- bytes/10
  minutes <- words/200
  ``` 
  (`r round(minutes)` min read)

In the following example, I am using the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)'s [Financial Well-Being Scale](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/financial-well-being/). 



This post has been inspired by @van2012checklist's checklist for testing for measurement invariance.
