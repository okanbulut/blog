 abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Summary This chapter demonstrates how the Ising model can be estimated. It shows that the Ising model is equivalent to, or closely related to, prominent modeling techniques in psychometrics. The chapter introduces the general class of models used in network analysis called Markov random fields. It also shows that the Ising model is closely related to the modeling framework of item response theory (IRT), which is of central importance to psychometrics. The chapter illustrates how network models could be useful in the conceptualization of psychometric data. Latent variables have played a central role in psychometric models. As psychometrics starts to deal with network models, the Ising model offers a canonical form for network psychometrics, because it deals with binary data and is equivalent to well-known models from IRT. The chapter focuses on the equivalence between the Ising model and multidimensional item response theory.}

abstract = {SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
